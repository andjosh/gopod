About
=====

This is a library implementing an RSS/Podcast feed generator for the Go programming
language (http://golang.org/).

RSS (Rich Site Summary, or Really Simple Syndication) is a data format used to
publish frequently updated works - such as blog entries, news headlines, audio
and video - in a standardized format. Podcasts utilize this format to deliver audio and video files and assiciated metadata.

An RSS document (which is called a "feed", "web feed", or "channel") includes
full or summarized text, plus metadata such as publishing dates and authorship.

Other Details
=====================

A few of the more obscure data points aren't implemented yet.
I haven't seen feeds that implement them yet and I just want to make sure my implementation is good.

If you find this package useful and want to give back, I'd greatly appreciate a link to my [Ruby developer](http://RubyDeveloper.com/) site.
